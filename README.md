## Configuration
This adapter does not need a configuration.

## Usage
You can send message to all authenticated users over messageBox ```sendTo('iogo', 'New message')```
or to specific user ```sendTo('iogo', {user: 'Username', text: 'Test message'})```.
User must be created before (please read the application documentation for further details).

It is possible to specify more than one recipient (just separate the Usernames by comma). For example: Recipient: "User1,User4,User5"

```
sendTo('iogo', {
    user:                   'Username',
    text:                   'New message',
    title:                  'VIP News',
    priority:               'high'
});
```

Callbacks are supported aswell:
```
sendTo('iogo', {title: 'News', text: 'New message'}, function (res) {
    console.log('Sent to ' + res + ' users');
});
```

**Possible options**:
- *user*: Single user or list of users
